## <span>üí°</span> Motivation

The idea for this project came to me as I was attempting to integrate the Tippin.me web button in another React 
project. This required me to reverse engineer some parts of the web button. The work piled up to the point where it 
made sense to make the React Tippin Button into a separate library, but it was such a minor feature that it didn't 
make sense to do so. I didn't have a lot of experience publishing NPM packages, so I decided to go all out on this 
one to simultaneously create a template for future libraries that include a project documentation site. If you don't 
find the Tippin Button particularly useful, this project should also serve as a useful template for creating high 
quality libraries that are publishable on NPM.
